Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews

Abstract:
Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task aimed at identifying and classifying the sentiment expressed in textual data. This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews to determine whether they convey positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The process involves text preprocessing techniques such as cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization, followed by the development and evaluation of machine leaming models for classification. The outcome of this project provides insights into customer opinions, aiding businesses in decision-making and improving customer satisfaction.

Methodology:
1. Data Collection
Source: Use publicly available datasets such as Kaggle's customer review datasets or scrape data from e-commerce websites.
2. Data Preprocessing
a. Cleaning the Text:
Remove special characters, numbers, and punctuation.
Convert text to lowercase.
Remove stopwords (e.g., "is," "the," "and").
b. Tokenization:
Split the text into individual words or tokens.
c. Lemmatization:
Reduce words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" -> "run").
